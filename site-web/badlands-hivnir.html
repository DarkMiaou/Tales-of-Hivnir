            <td><td2>The Badlands map is where the story of our hero really starts, being a hostile and semi-desertic area, it is home to a variety of mobs, such as Slimes, Drangonflies and other. The Badlands are constituted of 5 main areas : the Mountain, the Hill, the Valley, Hivnir and the Hermit. The Mountain is a location situated in the south east of the map, it is also where the entrance to the Deep Dark is found, home of the Gobin King. The Hill, similar to the Mountain, also is where the entrance to a cave is : the Windy Cave, home of the Skeletons. The Valley is an interesting site found South West of Hivnir where quest completions can be found. Hivnir is a lovely little town that the player will have to visit with houses, a bar and a cemetary. The Hermit is where the player will spawn in after the Tutorial, it is house inhabited by two hermits that will help the player to get on his feet.</td2></td>
